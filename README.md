# Abstract

We propose building an AI model that offers efficient discovery of educational YouTube videos based on the user’s questions and prompts. The initial focus will be limited to subjects such as mathematics, algorithms, biology, chemistry, and physics. Given a user input, the system will identify the core concept and return links to YouTube videos that explain or teach that topic.
	To achieve this, we will leverage a pre-trained language model—BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)—to generate semantic embeddings of both user inputs and video metadata. These embeddings enable the measurement of the semantic similarity between the user’s prompt and available videos, improving the relevance of search results beyond basic keyword matching.
